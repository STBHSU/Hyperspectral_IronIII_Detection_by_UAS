# Hyperspectral iron(III) detection by UAS for paint condition and corrosion assessment of steel structures

This repository contains the processed data from the paper "Hyperspectral iron(III) detection by UAS for paint condition and corrosion assessment of steel structures"

The bridge cap and main beam over a length of ca. 270 m of a steel bridge in Hamburg were inspected by hyperspectral imaging on a drone at a distance of five to ten meters within 10 minutes flight time.
Each second one data cube was acquired. Here, the processed images 5 to 347 are given.

Visibility of possible iron(III) corrosion content was enhanced by hNDFe3I (hyperspectral Normalized Difference Iron(III) Index) and SAM (spectral angle mapping) with goethite as a reference. Red indicates higher possible corrosion.

RGB images were calculated with https://github.com/JakobSig/HSI2RGB, see
M. Magnusson, J. Sigurdsson, S. E. Armansson, M. O. Ulfarsson, H. Deborah and J. R. Sveinsson, "Creating RGB Images from Hyperspectral Images Using a Color Matching Function," IGARSS 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2020, pp. 2045-2048, doi: 10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323397.

Data cube 121 had an acquisition error.
The images 151-159 are removed due to a necessary flight around vegetation.
